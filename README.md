## Compilation
This mod is written in a custom language for PS2 cheats called CLPS2C, so the first step to compile this mod is to use the [CLPS2C-Compiler](https://github.com/NiV-L-A/CLPS2C-Compiler/tree/master).

From version 1.0.2 of this compiler, you can compile the mod into a pnach that will run correctly in the game.
