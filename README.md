# Modern Persona Management
## Description
This mod for Persona 3 FES introduces several quality-of-life improvements to the camp menu, allowing for more efficient management of personas and their skills.

### Features
- Swap Persona's Order Quickly: Press L1/R1 to swap the current persona with your upper/down persona respectively.
- Quick Persona Assignment: Assign a persona directly from the persona list of the camp menu with the Triangle button.
- View Skill Details: Press Square to open a cursor in the persona details view and see a skill help window with descriptions of each skill.
- (Upcoming) Skill Reordering: The ability to reorder skills within a personaâ€™s skill list.

## Compilation
This mod is written in a custom language for PS2 cheats called CLPS2C, so the first step to compile this mod is to use the [CLPS2C-Compiler](https://github.com/NiV-L-A/CLPS2C-Compiler/tree/master).

However, in the current version of the compiler (1.0.1 at the time of writing), a bug causes the mod to compile incorrectly, resulting in a game crash during testing. To avoid this, you will need to use [alexankitty's](https://github.com/alexankitty) keystone pull request, which can be found [here](https://github.com/alexankitty/keystone). This ensures that the cheat compiles and runs correctly in the game.
